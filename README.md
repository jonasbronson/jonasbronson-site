Here lays my website made with love with Vite and React.js as an update to my old website that only utilized HTML and CSS. This website was good practice for me to code in the React.js and Vite frameworks and get used to them a little bit more.

This website holds an about section for me, both my video and coding portfolios, projects, and a way to contact me if you need.
